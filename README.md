# pricetracker

a price tracker that displays the following:

● First dropdown: Displays different markets available.
● Second dropdown: Based on the selection of the first dropdown, displays the available symbols available
for the selected market.
● Text: Shows the current price. The default colour is grey. It changes to red if the price goes down and
green if it goes up. The text colour goes back to grey if the price is unchanged.
Price Tracker

The app's flow:
• The application should start with a
loading indicator in the centre
while active symbols are fetching.
• After selecting a market and a
symbol, a loading indicator should
be shown in place of the symbol
price while the new price stream is
fetching.
• After changing the symbol, the
process mentioned in the second
step should repeat.
